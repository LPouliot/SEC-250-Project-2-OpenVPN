# [Project 2: OpenVPN Research and Implementation](https://github.com/LPouliot/SEC-250-Project-2-OpenVPN/wiki)

## Project Purpose: 
The purpose of this project is to establish a secure and efficient remote access solution for administering sensitive systems via a VPN (Virtual Private Network). This solution aims to enhance security by encrypting communication and implementing robust authentication methods.

## Project Goals and Outcomes

* Implement a VPN solution (OpenVPN) to enable remote administration of MGMT02 on the MGMT Segment.

* Ensure secure, encrypted communication for remote access.

* Configure multiple authentication layers to enhance security.

* Document the deployment process comprehensively for future reference.

* Demonstrate successful remote access to MGMT02 via VPN through a video tutorial.
